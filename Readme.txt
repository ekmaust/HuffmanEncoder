Huffman Compression - Emily Maust
---------------------------------

The completed graph can be found in the folder 'Stats'.

When the program is run, it will ask the user whether they would like to run the customized
or the standard version of compression.
 - Typing 'c' creates a Huffman tree (and code) based on custom character frequencies (found in the doc).
 - Typing 's' creates a Huffman tree (and code) based on standard character frequencies.

As the program completes each file, it will output "'title' Completed!"
Once the program has completed all files, it will output "Goodbye." and terminate.
The files (both encoded and decoded) can now be found in their respective folders.

To run the other version, it must be terminated and started again.
